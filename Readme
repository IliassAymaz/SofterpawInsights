We want to be able to pull data from our search console

and generate insights for some questions

Examples of questions we might want to consider:
"""
|- Basic questions to get started with:
|-- Which posts (-> categories) drove the most impressions in the last X weeks? 
|-- 
|
|- More advanced:
|-- Which posts were the 'fastest' in terms of ranking up in Google rankings?


Afterwards, we want to build an "AI" system, capable of "choosing" and telling us:
- Which category to choose
- and/or what should our next article be about 

This implies the existence of a data set
