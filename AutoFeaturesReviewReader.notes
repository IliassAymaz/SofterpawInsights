#### ... and an additional feature

We want to be able to automatically detect the main features of a product and the pros and cons that 
users came up with. 

Technically : 

+ Crawl amazon product page for features and all review text.
+ LDA to extract review main keywords (topics), to actually get
 the pros and cons in a certain way (we're not quite sure now).
