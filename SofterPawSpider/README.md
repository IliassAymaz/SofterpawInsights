We want to be able to build our own web scraper for our keywords intel needs.

The idea is to:

+ be able to find the optimal keywords for the next batch of content based on competitor's content
+ build get the Sentiment for the set of the next products to produce content around (Amazon...) (This would be a huge life savior).
