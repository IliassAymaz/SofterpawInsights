# SofterpawInsights

## Motivation
We want to be able to pull data from our search console that is directly linked to our
affiliate marketing blog.

We also want to be able to generate insights for some *key* questions.

### Examples of questions we might want to consider:

|- Basic questions to get started with:
|-- Which posts (-> categories) drove the most impressions in the last X weeks? 
|-- 
|
|- More advanced:
|-- Which posts were the 'fastest' in terms of ranking up in Google?

### And towards a web app, sort of

Afterwards, we want to build an "AI" system, capable of "choosing" and telling us:
- Which category to choose
- and/or what should our next article be about 

We can build that as a "web app", full stack, and make it available to front end usage,
input being which question to select, and output being the predicted 
category/cluster of keywords to write the next article about.
